what is component less route
ChatGPT
In Angular, a component-less route refers to a route configuration that does not have a corresponding component associated with it. Instead of rendering a component's template when the route is activated, a component-less route is typically used to define child routes or to perform auxiliary tasks like redirects or route guards.

To define a component-less route in Angular, you can configure the route in the router module by specifying an empty component or using the children property to define child routes without a component.

Here's an example of a component-less route configuration in Angular:

typescript
Copy code
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

import { HomeComponent } from './home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about.component';
import { ContactComponent } from './contact.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent }, // Regular route with a component
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }, // Regular route with a component
  {
    path: 'contact',
    children: [
      { path: '', redirectTo: 'us', pathMatch: 'full' }, // Redirect to child route
      { path: 'us', component: ContactComponent }, // Child route with a component
      { path: 'team', component: ContactComponent }, // Child route with a component
    ]
  },
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '' } // Default redirect for any other route
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
In the example above, we have a regular route configuration with components (HomeComponent and AboutComponent), as well as a component-less route configuration for the /contact path.

The /contact path has child routes defined using the children property. The child routes (/contact/us and /contact/team) can have their own components associated with them or can be component-less routes themselves.

The component-less route is often used for structural purposes, such as defining nested routes or for implementing route guards, resolvers, or redirects. It allows you to organize and manage your routes effectively without the need for a corresponding component to be rendered.

Remember to configure the appropriate <router-outlet> in your component templates to render the appropriate components for the routes, as component-less routes won't have their own component to render.
