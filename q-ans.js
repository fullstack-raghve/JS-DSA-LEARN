Certainly! Here are some tricky Angular interview questions along with their answers:

Q: What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?
A: AngularJS is the first version of the framework, also known as Angular 1.x, while Angular refers to versions 2 and above. Angular introduced significant changes, including a component-based architecture and improved performance.

Q: Explain the concept of lazy loading in Angular.
A: Lazy loading is a technique where modules or components are loaded only when they are needed, reducing the initial loading time of the application. It helps improve performance by loading resources on-demand.

Q: What is the purpose of Angular CLI, and how is it beneficial?
A: Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool for initializing, developing, and deploying Angular applications. It automates common development tasks, such as scaffolding components, generating code, running tests, and optimizing production builds.

Q: How does Angular achieve two-way data binding?
A: Angular uses a concept called "digest cycle" to track changes in the data model and update the view automatically. It binds the data in the model to the view and vice versa, allowing changes in one to reflect in the other.

Q: What is the purpose of the ngOnInit() lifecycle hook in Angular?
A: The ngOnInit() hook is part of the Angular lifecycle hooks and is called after the component's data-bound properties have been initialized. It is commonly used to perform initialization tasks, such as retrieving data from a server.

Q: What are Angular directives, and how are they different from components?
A: Directives and components are similar in Angular, but components have a template associated with them, while directives do not. Directives are used to modify the behavior or appearance of existing elements, whereas components are self-contained and have their own view.

Q: How can you share data between components in Angular?
A: Data sharing between components can be achieved through various techniques, such as input and output properties, services, and shared state management libraries like NgRx or Redux.

Q: What are Angular Guards, and why are they useful?
A: Angular Guards are used to control the navigation and access to routes in an Angular application. They allow you to protect routes based on conditions, such as user authentication or role-based authorization.

Q: How can you improve the performance of an Angular application?
A: Performance optimization in Angular can be achieved through techniques like lazy loading, code minification and bundling, Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, tree shaking, caching, and optimizing network requests.

Q: Explain the concept of change detection in Angular.
A: Change detection is the process by which Angular determines if the data model has changed and updates the view accordingly. Angular uses change detection strategies like Default, OnPush, and Detached to efficiently update the view.

Remember, these questions are designed to assess your understanding of Angular concepts and your problem-solving skills. It's essential to provide clear and concise answers while showcasing your practical experience with Angular development.
