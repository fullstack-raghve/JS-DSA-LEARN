To detect the idle state or inactivity of a user in an Angular application, you can utilize the ng-idle package, which provides a convenient way to track user idle time. Here's how you can implement it in Angular:

Step 1: Install the ng-idle package using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install angular-idle
Step 2: Import the NgIdleModule into your Angular module:

typescript
Copy code
import { NgIdleModule } from '@ng-idle/core';

@NgModule({
  imports: [NgIdleModule.forRoot()],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule { }
Step 3: Implement idle detection in a component:

typescript
Copy code
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Idle } from '@ng-idle/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-idle-detection',
  template: `
    <p>Idle time: {{ idleState.idleTime | date: 'HH:mm:ss' }}</p>
    <p>Is user idle? {{ idleState.isIdle ? 'Yes' : 'No' }}</p>
  `
})
export class IdleDetectionComponent implements OnInit {
  idleState: any;

  constructor(private idle: Idle) { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.idle.setIdle(5); // Set idle time in seconds (e.g., 5 seconds)
    this.idle.setTimeout(5); // Set timeout countdown in seconds (e.g., 5 seconds)
    this.idle.setInterrupts(DEFAULT_INTERRUPTSOURCES);

    this.idle.onIdleEnd.subscribe(() => {
      this.idleState = { isIdle: false, idleTime: 0 };
    });

    this.idle.onTimeout.subscribe(() => {
      // Perform actions when the timeout is reached
      console.log('User is idle');
    });

    this.idle.onIdleStart.subscribe(() => {
      this.idleState = { isIdle: true, idleTime: this.idle.getIdleTime() };
    });

    this.idle.onTimeoutWarning.subscribe((countdown) => {
      // Perform actions when the timeout warning is triggered
      console.log(`Timeout in ${countdown} seconds`);
    });

    this.idle.init();
  }
}
In this example, the Idle service from @ng-idle/core is injected into the component. The idle configuration is set using the setIdle and setTimeout methods, specifying the idle time and the timeout countdown, respectively.

Event subscriptions are set up to handle various idle-related events, such as onIdleEnd, onTimeout, onIdleStart, and onTimeoutWarning. These events allow you to perform actions when the user becomes idle, the timeout is reached, the idle state ends, or the timeout warning is triggered.

The init method is called to initialize the idle tracking.

In the template, you can display the idle time and whether the user is idle by binding to the idleState object properties.

Make sure to import the necessary modules and dependencies, including the DEFAULT_INTERRUPTSOURCES if you want to include additional interrupt sources for user activity.

Remember to customize the actions to be taken when the user is idle or when the timeout is reached based on your specific requirements.

With the ng-idle package, you can easily implement idle detection in your Angular application and perform actions accordingly when the user becomes inactive.
